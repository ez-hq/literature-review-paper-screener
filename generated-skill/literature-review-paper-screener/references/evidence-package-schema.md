# Evidence package schema (local → cloud handoff)

**One file = one paper (V1.1 per-paper execution).** The Cloud template screens **one paper per
cloud task**, so every evidence file must contain exactly one paper's record. Each file keeps the
same shape the Cloud has already validated: a run-context block and a `papers` array holding
**exactly one** record. Never bundle multiple papers into one file — that reintroduces the
single-task timeout failure (StartToClose timeout on 20-paper single-row submissions).

- File naming: `handoff_p<record_id>.json` (e.g. `handoff_p001.json`).
- Every file carries the **same `run_context`** (identical copy) plus that paper's single record.
- The Cloud reads each row's `papers[0]`; record fields must carry explicit availability; never
  fabricate values.

## Serialization rules

- Compact JSON (no pretty-printing); keys in the fixed order shown in this document; stable byte
  encoding (`ensure_ascii=False`, UTF-8, no trailing whitespace) so the same record always
  serializes to identical bytes (reproducible rerun condition).
- A record with missing fields uses `""` / `false` / `[]` rather than omitting keys, per the
  available-data rules.

## Run context block

```json
{
  "run_context": {
    "research_question": "...",
    "core_concepts": ["..."],
    "research_focus": "effect|impact|association|relationship|comparison|mechanism",
    "population": "...",
    "context": "..."
  }
}
```

These five keys are the run-context shape validated against the Cloud. Optional context such as
restrictions, assignment requirements, deadline, reading time, and citation count is passed to the
Cloud via the workbook fields (Assignment Requirements / Research Restrictions / etc.) — it does
not need to be repeated inside the evidence file (including it is harmless but not required).

## Paper record (papers[0] — exactly one per file)

```json
{
  "run_context": {
    "research_question": "...",
    "core_concepts": ["..."],
    "research_focus": "effect|impact|association|relationship|comparison|mechanism",
    "population": "...",
    "context": "..."
  },
  "papers": [
    {
      "record_id": "P001",
      "title": "...",
      "authors": "...",
      "publication_year": 2021,
      "source_journal_publisher": "...",
      "source_type": "peer-reviewed journal article",
      "doi": "...",
      "isbn": "",
      "url": "...",
      "database_record": "PMID: ...; PubMed",
      "abstract": "...",
      "available_content": {
        "full_text_available": true,
        "sections_available": ["introduction", "methods", "results", "discussion", "conclusion"],
        "methods_info": "...",
        "key_findings": "...",
        "results_info": "...",
        "conclusion": "..."
      },
      "links": ["https://doi.org/..."],
      "evidence_availability_level": "A",
      "available_evidence": "...",
      "missing_evidence": "...",
      "assessment_limitations": "...",
      "metadata_status": "VERIFIED",
      "metadata_gate_notes": "DOI resolved in Crossref; PMID matched in PubMed; all identifiers refer to the same publication."
    }
  ]
}
```

> The `run_context` block shown above is repeated identically in every per-paper file. The
> `papers` array holds exactly one record — this file's paper. (The standalone `run_context` block
> shown earlier is the shared copy every file embeds.)

> `metadata_status` is produced by the local **Metadata Validation Gate**
> (references/metadata-validation-gate.md) — `VERIFIED` or `PARTIALLY VERIFIED` only. For
> PARTIALLY VERIFIED records, mark each unverifiable identifier as `NOT VERIFIED` (e.g.
> `"doi": "NOT VERIFIED"`). Records that are `MISMATCH` / `INVALID` never reach this file. The
> Cloud ignores this field — it screens only the evidence content.

## Evidence Availability Level assignment

| Level | Package contains |
|---|---|
| A | Full text, or substantial full-paper content (Methods, Results, Discussion, Conclusion) |
| B | Abstract + substantial structured information |
| C | Title + metadata + Abstract |
| D | Title, authors, year, journal/publisher only |

Do not require full text for every paper. Paywalls, no open access, access restrictions, and PDF
retrieval failures are expected; they lower the level, never the paper's fate.
